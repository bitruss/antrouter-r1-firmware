# antrouter-r1-firmware

CrazyGuy has a custom firmware for R1-BTC

Firmware Enhancements
- Supports modifying R1 pools from UI, without losing the ability to use Bitmain's solo pool for R1.
- Detailed R1 stats page, including pool statistics
- Supports modifying R1 freq and voltage from UI
- Max fequency for R1 increased to 250M (I have not personally tested freq past 125. Use at your own risk!)


WARNING: These customizations provide the ability to push your R1 beyond its intended limits. Because of this, it will likely void your warranty with Bitmain. Additionally, I provide this patch with no official support, and take no responsibility for any damage done to your R1 device or its surroundings. Use at your own risk! By downloading and applying this patch, the user is accepting these conditions.
